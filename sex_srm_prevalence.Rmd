# Albert: It looks odd that the general SRMM prevalence is 31%, 
# but the prevalence of either males or females is only 21%. 
# Why is that? Is sex data more often available for non-infants?
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

df <- hgm_subject_df

ggplot(df, aes(x = age_years, fill = is.na(sex_all))) +
  geom_histogram()

ggplot(df, aes(x = age_years, fill = is.na(sex_all))) +
  geom_boxplot()



```
# conclusion: The demographic of subjects in which data on sex is available is more skewed towards infants that the entire subject pool. This is a likely explanation for why the prevalence of SRM in subjects with sex data is 21%, while overall it is 30%.
